# efficiency things
only 512 bytes of EEPROM, probably need to not save all of GameSettings.


# factorings
move eeprom stuff to its own

# code cleanup
how to avoid duplicate menu handler functions for each game type? ie,
   loadMostHitsSettings
   loadFirstToHitsSettings
   loadOwnZoneSettings


# expansions/generalizations
how to provide more slots? 

#hardware
wire in encoder. i hate the button. can use the same pins the buttons were on since they are pull down

# testing
really need to add tests for game updates
